## General Principles of the Warp Network

1. WarpNet cannot be owned by anyone.
2. WarpNet must operate independently of any third-party services.
3. WarpNet must not rely on any proprietary or third-party technologies.
4. A WarpNet node must be distributed as a single executable file.
5. WarpNet must be a cross-platform solution.
6. Only one WarpNet member node may run on a single machine, but it may have multiple aliases.
7. WarpNet member nodes must be governed solely by network consensus.
8. WarpNet business nodes may allow centralized management.
9. WarpNet business nodes must responsibly run at least one bootstrap node.
10. A WarpNet node must store private data only on the local host machine.
11. WarpNet member nodes must not be developed or controlled by a single individual.
12. Content on WarpNet must be moderated automatically, without human intervention.
13. Hosting a WarpNet bootstrap node must be incentivized with rewards.
14. Node owners bear full personal responsibility for any content they upload to WarpNet.
