Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 15.05.2025

WarpNet is a peer-to-peer network designed with privacy, user autonomy, and decentralization in mind.
This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and the responsibilities you have as a WarpNet user.

1. No Central Data Collection

WarpNet does not store any of your personal data on centralized servers. All your data — including messages, media,
and account settings — is stored locally on your own device.

2. Local-Only Storage

Your account, content, and preferences exist only on your device. WarpNet does not back up, sync, or remotely store
your data. If you lose access to your device or its data is destroyed, your account cannot be recovered.
You are responsible for making your own backups.

3. Peer-to-Peer Communication

When you communicate with other WarpNet users, data is transmitted directly between devices using end-to-end protocols.
WarpNet nodes do not act as intermediaries and cannot access the contents of your communications.

4. No Tracking, No Ads (for now)

WarpNet does not track your usage, behavior, or location. Currently, there is no advertising system integrated into
WarpNet. However, sponsored content may be introduced in the future, and will always be clearly marked.

5. Your Responsibility

As a WarpNet user, you are solely responsible for the content you upload or distribute. Do not share illegal, harmful,
or abusive material. WarpNet is an open system, but local community moderation may apply depending on node policies.

6. Open Source Transparency

WarpNet is open-source software. Anyone may inspect, audit, or modify the code. This ensures transparency and encourages
privacy-respecting development practices.

7. GDPR and CCPA Compliance

WarpNet is designed to minimize data collection and empower user control, in line with the principles of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

However, due to its decentralized architecture, there is no centralized data controller or processor.
All data remains under your control on your local device. Therefore:

    We do not collect or store any personal information.

    We do not sell or share data with third parties.

    You are in full control of your data and its removal.

    There is no centralized entity to submit data access or deletion requests to — you already possess full access.

By using WarpNet, you acknowledge and accept this decentralized responsibility model.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect future changes in the software or legal requirements. You will be notified
via the WarpNet interface when updates occur.
