# How to Help WarpNet

WarpNet is a free, open, and decentralized social protocol. There is no central owner — 
just people building together. If you want to help, there are many ways to contribute:

---

## 1. **Test the Software**

* Try running a node on your platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Use the UI, break things, and report issues
* Experiment with multi-node setups in your LAN or VPN

Bug reports are always appreciated:
→ [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/warp-net/warpnet/issues)

---

## 2. **Improve the Code**

* Read the source code and open PRs
* Fix bugs, add missing error handling
* Optimize critical paths (e.g., message storage, discovery)
* Fix the frontend (PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE)

Look at [good first issues](https://github.com/warp-net/warpnet/labels/good%20first%20issue) if you're new.

---

## 3. **Build Tools and Interfaces**

* Write a desktop client or cross-platform GUI
* Make a mobile aliases (iOS and Android)
* Create visualizations or dashboards for peers/network metrics

WarpNet is modular. Anything that speaks the protocol can join the network.

---

## 4. **Research and Audit**

* Review the cryptographic primitives (Noise, PSK, local key derivation)
* Propose improvements to moderation, discovery, or reputation models
* Help design trust-minimizing coordination methods

---

## 5. **Write and Document**

* Translate the documentation into your language
* Write tutorials or explainers (e.g., “How WarpNet stores tweets locally”)
* Improve error messages or CLI help output

---

## 6. **Run Infrastructure**

* Host a publicly reachable bootstrap node (PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE)
* Mirror binaries or snapshots
* Help with continuous integration or builds

---

## 7. **Spread the Word**

* Share WarpNet with like-minded developers
* Star the repository to increase its visibility

---

If you’re doing any of the above, you’re already helping. WarpNet is not a startup. 
There is no monetization. It's a protocol for people who want to own their tools.
