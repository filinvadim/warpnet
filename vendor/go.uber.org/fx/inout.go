// This allows it to make use of advanced dependency injection features.
// See package documentation for more information.

// It's recommended that shared modules use a single parameter struct to
// provide a forward-compatible API:
// adding new optional fields to a struct is backward-compatible,
// so modules can evolve as needs change.

// Out is the inverse of In: it marks a struct as a result struct so that
// it can be used with advanced dependency injection features.
// See package documentation for more information.

// adding new fields to a struct is backward-compatible,
