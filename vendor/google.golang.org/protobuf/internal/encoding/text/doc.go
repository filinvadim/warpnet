// Package text implements the text format for protocol buffers.
// This package has no semantic understanding for protocol buffers and is only
// a parser and composer for the format.
//
// There is no formal specification for the protobuf text format, as such the
// C++ implementation (see google::protobuf::TextFormat) is the reference
// implementation of the text format.
//
// This package is neither a superset nor a subset of the C++ implementation.
// This implementation permits a more liberal grammar in some cases to be
// backwards compatible with the historical Go implementation.
// Future parsings unique to Go should not be added.
// Some grammars allowed by the C++ implementation are deliberately
// not implemented here because they are considered a bug by the protobuf team
// and should not be replicated.
//
// The Go implementation should implement a sufficient amount of the C++
// grammar such that the default text serialization by C++ can be parsed by Go.
// However, just because the C++ parser accepts some input does not mean that
// the Go implementation should as well.
//
// The text format is almost a superset of JSON except:
//   - message keys are not quoted strings, but identifiers
//   - the top-level value must be a message without the delimiters
