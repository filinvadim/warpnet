// ProtoLegacy specifies whether to enable support for legacy functionality
// such as MessageSets, and various other obscure behavior
// that is necessary to maintain backwards compatibility with proto1 or
// the pre-release variants of proto2 and proto3.
//
// This is disabled by default unless built with the "protolegacy" tag.
//
// WARNING: The compatibility agreement covers nothing provided by this flag.
// As such, functionality may suddenly be removed or changed at our discretion.

// LazyUnmarshalExtensions specifies whether to lazily unmarshal extensions.
//
// Lazy extension unmarshaling validates the contents of message-valued
// extension fields at unmarshal time, but defers creating the message
// structure until the extension is first accessed.
