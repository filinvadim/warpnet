// darwinSupportsAVX512 checks Darwin kernel for AVX512 support via sysctl
// call (see issue 43089). It also restricts AVX512 support for Darwin to
// kernel version 21.3.0 (MacOS 12.2.0) or later (see issue 49233).
//
// Background:
// Darwin implements a special mechanism to economize on thread state when
// AVX512 specific registers are not in use. This scheme minimizes state when
// preempting threads that haven't yet used any AVX512 instructions, but adds
// special requirements to check for AVX512 hardware support at runtime (e.g.
// via sysctl call or commpage inspection). See issue 43089 and link below for
// full background:
// https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-11215.1.10/osfmk/i386/fpu.c#L214-L240
//
// Additionally, all versions of the Darwin kernel from 19.6.0 through 21.2.0
// (corresponding to MacOS 10.15.6 - 12.1) have a bug that can cause corruption
// of the AVX512 mask registers (K0-K7) upon signal return. For this reason
// AVX512 is considered unsafe to use on Darwin for kernel versions prior to
// 21.3.0, where a fix has been confirmed. See issue 49233 for full background.
