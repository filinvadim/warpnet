// BOMOverride returns a new decoder transformer that is identical to fallback,
// except that the presence of a Byte Order Mark at the start of the input
// causes it to switch to the corresponding Unicode decoding. It will only
// consider BOMs for UTF-8, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE.
//
// This differs from using ExpectBOM by allowing a BOM to switch to UTF-8, not
// just UTF-16 variants, and allowing falling back to any encoding scheme.
//
// This technique is recommended by the W3C for use in HTML 5: "For
// compatibility with deployed content, the byte order mark (also known as BOM)
// is considered more authoritative than anything else."
// http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/#specification-hooks
//
// Using BOMOverride is mostly intended for use cases where the first characters
// of a fallback encoding are known to not be a BOM, for example, for valid HTML
// and most encodings.
