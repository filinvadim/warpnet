// watermarks. When queried, it will determine the next trigger point based
// on the current utilisation. If the last watermark is surpassed,
// the policy will be disarmed. It is recommended to set an extreme watermark
// as the last element (e.g. 0.99) to prevent the policy from disarming too soon.
