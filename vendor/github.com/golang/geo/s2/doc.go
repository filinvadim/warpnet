Package s2 is a library for working with geometry in S² (spherical geometry).

Its related packages, parallel to this one, are s1 (operates on S¹), r1 (operates on ℝ¹),
r2 (operates on ℝ²) and r3 (operates on ℝ³).

This package provides types and functions for the S2 cell hierarchy and coordinate systems.
The S2 cell hierarchy is a hierarchical decomposition of the surface of a unit sphere (S²)
into ``cells''; it is highly efficient, scales from continental size to under 1 cm²
and preserves spatial locality (nearby cells have close IDs).

More information including an in-depth introduction to S2 can be found on the
S2 website https://s2geometry.io/
