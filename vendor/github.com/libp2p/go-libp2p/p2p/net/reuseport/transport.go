// Package reuseport provides a basic transport for automatically (and intelligently) reusing TCP ports.
//
// To use, construct a new Transport and configure listeners tr.Listen(...).
// When dialing (tr.Dial(...)), the transport will attempt to reuse the ports it's currently listening on,
// choosing the best one depending on the destination address.
//
// It is recommended to set SO_LINGER to 0 for all connections, otherwise
// reusing the port may fail when re-dialing a recently closed connection.
// See https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/addrinuse.html for details.
