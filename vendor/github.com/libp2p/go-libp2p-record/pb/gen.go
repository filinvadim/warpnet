// These commands work around namespace conflicts that occur when multiple
// repositories depend on .proto files with generic filenames. Due to the way
// protobuf registers files (e.g., foo.proto or pb/foo.proto), naming
// collisions can occur when the same filename is used across different
// packages.
//
// The only way to generate a *.pb.go file that includes the full package path
// (e.g., github.com/org/repo/pb/foo.proto) is to place the .proto file in a
// directory structure that mirrors its package path.
