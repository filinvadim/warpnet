	// to send the packet to (if necessary), the preferred src IP to use (if
	// available).  If the preferred src address is not given in the routing
	// table, the first IP address of the interface is provided.
	//
	// If an error is encountered, iface, geteway, and
	// preferredSrc will be nil, and err will be set.
