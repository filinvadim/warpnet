// Package require implements the same assertions as the `assert` package but
// stops test execution when a test fails.
//
// # Example Usage
//
// The following is a complete example using require in a standard test function:
//
//	import (
//	  "testing"
//	  "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
//	)
//
//	func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
//
//	  var a string = "Hello"
//	  var b string = "Hello"
//
//	  require.Equal(t, a, b, "The two words should be the same.")
//
//	}
//
// # Assertions
//
// The `require` package have same global functions as in the `assert` package,
// but instead of returning a boolean result they call `t.FailNow()`.
//
// Every assertion function also takes an optional string message as the final argument,
// allowing custom error messages to be appended to the message the assertion method outputs.
