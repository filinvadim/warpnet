# **Terms and Conditions of WarpNet**

Effective Date: 15/05/2025
Last Updated: 15/05/2025

By using WarpNet, you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms,
you must not use WarpNet.

1. Nature of the Service

WarpNet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) platform enabling users to communicate, share content, and
interact without centralized control. All user data is stored locally and transmitted directly between peers.
WarpNet is open-source and maintained by a community of independent contributors.

2. User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for all content you create, upload, share, or distribute using WarpNet.
There is no centralized moderation or enforcement; however, peer nodes may enforce local policies, block traffic,
 or filter content according to their own configurations.

3. Acceptable Content Policy

You agree not to upload, share, or distribute any content that includes or promotes any of the following:

    - Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any sexual content involving minors.
    - AI-generated depictions of minors in pornographic or sexualized contexts (including deepfakes or synthetic media).
    - Non-consensual sexual content, or any pornography involving violence, coercion, or abuse.
    - Gore, depictions of extreme violence, dead bodies, or snuff-like material.
    - Instructions for the creation, assembly, or use of weapons, explosives, or other instruments of harm.
    - The sale, exchange, or promotion of illegal drugs or controlled substances.
    - Content that promotes or glorifies suicide, self-harm, or self-mutilation.
    - Content glorifying or encouraging eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, or related behaviors.
    - Sexism, racism, caste-based discrimination, xenophobia, or other forms of hate speech or chauvinism.
    - Religious extremism, sectarian violence, or incitement to terrorism.
    - Unsolicited commercial spam, mass messaging, or any form of automated promotional content.

4. Permissible Content

WarpNet explicitly allows the following categories of content, provided they comply with applicable local laws:

    - Legal adult pornography, involving only consenting adults and free of coercion or violent acts.
    - Gambling and casino-related content, including betting platforms, informational material,
      and promotional content.
    - Cryptocurrency-related content, including educational materials, platforms, trading tools,
      and decentralized financial systems (DeFi, NFTs, tokens, etc.).

You are fully responsible for ensuring that any such content is legal in your jurisdiction and does not violate
the rights of others.

5. Data Ownership and Risk

All data and content you create are stored exclusively on your device. WarpNet does not store, back up,
or replicate your data unless explicitly configured to do so by you. In case of hardware failure, loss,
or data corruption, your account and its content may be permanently lost. You are solely responsible for
any backups or data migration.

6. No Guarantees of Access or Service

As a decentralized protocol, WarpNet offers no guaranteed availability, quality of service, or support.
Node behavior, network availability, and routing efficiency depend entirely on the peers you connect to
and the quality of your local setup.

7. Privacy Principles and Legal Context

WarpNet is designed to reflect the spirit of privacy principles found in laws such as the GDPR and CCPA.
However, due to its decentralized architecture, these laws do not apply, as there is no centralized
data controller or processor.
WarpNet does not collect or process personal data. All information remains local to your device unless
voluntarily shared with peers. There is no central authority to submit data access or deletion requests to.

8. Encrypted Forensic Metadata

To help deter the distribution of illegal and harmful media content, WarpNet automatically embeds
encrypted forensic metadata into every media file uploaded through the platform.
This metadata includes:

    - The originating IP address (as seen by the local system), and
    - The device MAC address, or a device-specific hardware identifier,
    - Username, account ID and other user and node specific information.

These values are encrypted using computationally expensive cryptographic method such that:

    - The metadata is not accessible to ordinary users, even those with technical skills.
    - However, entities with substantial computing resources, such as data centers or law enforcement agencies,
      may be able to decrypt the metadata under lawful circumstances.

This mechanism does not affect the usability, appearance, or sharing behavior of media files within WarpNet.
It is designed solely as a deterrent against the spread of unlawful material, particularly child sexual abuse
imagery, violent content, and other prohibited media as defined in Section 3.
Users remain fully responsible for the legality of their shared content.
By using WarpNet, you consent to this metadata policy as part of the platform’s content integrity strategy.

9. Amendments

These Terms and Conditions may be updated periodically to reflect community decisions, software changes,
or legal developments. You will be notified through the WarpNet interface when significant changes occur.
Continued use of WarpNet implies acceptance of the latest version of these terms.

10. Governance and Contact

WarpNet is not operated by a single entity. The project is developed and maintained by a decentralized community.
For questions, contributions, or reports, contact the maintainers via the official WarpNet GitHub repository —
'https://github.com/Warp-net' or community discussion channels — 'https://t.me/warpnetdev'.
