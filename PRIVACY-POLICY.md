# **Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: 15/05/2025

WarpNet is a peer-to-peer network designed with privacy, user autonomy, and decentralization in mind.
This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and the responsibilities you have as a WarpNet user.

1. No Central Data Collection

WarpNet does not store any of your personal data on centralized servers — there're no centralized servers.
All your data — including messages, media, and account settings — is stored locally on your own device.

2. Local-Only Storage

Your account, content, and preferences exist only on your device. WarpNet does not back up, sync, or remotely store
your data. If you lose access to your device or its data is destroyed, your account cannot be recovered.
You are responsible for making your own backups.

3. Peer-to-Peer Communication

When you communicate with other WarpNet users, data is transmitted directly between devices using end-to-end protocols.
WarpNet nodes do not act as intermediaries and cannot access the contents of your communications.
All your communications — including messages, media, and metadata — are transmitted using end-to-end encryption
based on the Noise Protocol Framework. This ensures that only the intended recipients can decrypt the data.
Other WarpNet nodes cannot access the contents of any communication, even if they participate in routing traffic.

4. Tracking-Free by Design. Sponsored Content May Be Introduced

WarpNet does not track your usage, behavior, or location. Currently, there is no advertising system integrated into
WarpNet. However, sponsored content may be introduced in the future, and will always be clearly marked.
To preserve your privacy, WarpNet does not collect or use geolocation data. Instead, approximate network latency may be
measured passively to determine a relevant set of nearby recipients for sponsored content delivery. This process is
fully local, anonymized, and does not involve tracking or profiling.

5. Your Responsibility

As a WarpNet user, you are solely responsible for the content you upload or distribute. Do not share illegal, harmful,
or abusive material. WarpNet is an open system, but local community moderation may apply depending on node policies.

6. Open Source Transparency

WarpNet is open-source software. Anyone may inspect, audit, or modify the code. This ensures transparency and encourages
privacy-respecting development practices.

7. GDPR and CCPA: Applicability in a Decentralized Context

WarpNet is designed to follow the ethos of privacy principles of laws such as the GDPR and CCPA. However, due to its
decentralized architecture, these laws do not apply, as there is no centralized data controller or processor.

All data remains under your control on your local device. Therefore:

    - Nobody collect or store any personal information.
    - Nobody sell or share data with third parties.
    - You are in full control of your data and its removal.
    - Here is no centralized entity to submit data access
      or deletion requests to — you already possess full access.

By using WarpNet, you acknowledge and accept this decentralized responsibility model.

8. Encrypted Forensic Metadata in Media Files

To discourage the spread of illegal and disturbing media content, WarpNet automatically embeds encrypted
forensic metadata into media files uploaded through the platform. This metadata includes the originating
IP address, the device MAC address, username, account ID and other user and node specific information at the
time of upload. These identifiers are encrypted using computationally expensive method that make decryption
infeasible for the average user.
However, it may be technically possible for entities with substantial computing resources — such as law enforcement
agencies, security research institutions, or data centers — to decrypt such metadata under lawful conditions.
This mechanism is not intended for routine surveillance or user tracking. It serves as a deterrent against the
anonymous dissemination of prohibited material such as:

    - Child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
    - Non-consensual pornography
    - Violent or gory content
    - Other material outlined in WarpNet's Terms and Conditions

WarpNet does not collect or store this metadata centrally. It is embedded in the file itself and remains
inaccessible to the WarpNet platform or its users under normal operation.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect future changes in the software or legal requirements. You will be notified
via the WarpNet interface when updates occur.
